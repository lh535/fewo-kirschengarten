# Ferienwohnung Kirschengarten
Website for our families' holiday home. Built from scratch without any frameworks, and basic javascript.  
My first web development project, so it might be kind of a mess.  


### Personal Notes:
In retrospect, it would've been wise to use things like jQuery instead of limiting myself to only the basics and implementing  
already existing things on my own, because it's unlikely that this practice will ever come in particularly handy...  
For the future, I'll also consider bootstrap, and sass instead of less for css.  
The code could use a cleanup, but should be reasonably maintainable, especially compared to the website from before.
