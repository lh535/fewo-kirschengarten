# Ferienwohnung Kirschengarten
Website for our families' holiday home. Link: http://fewo-kirschengarten.de  
Built from scratch without any frameworks, and basic javascript.  
It's fairly straightforward, with not too many features. Design, photos and descriptions are also by me, with some  
additions from family members.  
It's also my first web development project! Despite being used as an official website, this was considered more of a hobby  
project for me, and I self-taught myself everything I used. It's unlikely the result will be seen by too many people,  
but I tried to make it look and feel reasonably good, with limited experience.

### Personal Notes:
In retrospect, it wasn't too necessary to not use things like jQuery instead of limiting myself to only the basics and implementing already existing things on my own, because it's kind of an arbitrarily limitation.   
It was reasonable to not jump into unnecessary huge frameworks or something when I can't accurately judge them yet, but for next projects it would be wise to look into it again.  
Other things to consider would be bootstrap, and sass instead of less for css.  
One positive to the approach is that I find the whole thing pretty readable (though it's not perfect in this either), and I know what everything does. Maintainability shouldn't be much of an issue (especially compared to the old site, which was written entirely in a rather outdated version of Joomla).  
In total, I feel like I'm now definitely more comfortable with HTML, CSS and to an extent, Javascript.  
Another quick note - I should get into the habit of using git in a more organized way, with more smaller commits instead of big ones that contain multiple changes.
